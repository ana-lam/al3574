   Such a captive maiden, having plenty of time to think, soon realizes that her tower, its height and architecture, are like her ego only incidental: that what really keeps her where she is is magic, anonymous and malignant, visited on her from outside and for no reason at all. Having no apparatus except gut fear and female cunning to examine this formless magic, to understand how it works, how to measure its field strength, count its lines of force, she may fall back on superstition, or take up a useful hobby like embroidery, or go mad, or marry a disk jockey. If the tower is everywhere and the knight of deliverance no proof against its magic, what else?</br>

      I saw no Way&mdash;The Heavens were stitched&mdash;</br>
      I felt the Columns close&mdash;</br>
      The Earth reversed her Hemispheres&mdash;</br>
      I touched the Universe&mdash;</br>
      </br>
      And back it slid&mdash;and I alone&mdash;</br>

   Ananda briefly saw this angle of the world. The eyes he had cut and focussed with his father's chisel showed him this. The birds dove towards gaps within the trees! They flew through the shelves of heat currents. The tiniest of hearts in them beating exhausted and fact, the way Sirissa had died in the story he invented for her in the vacuum of her disappearance. A small brave heart. In the heights she loved and in the dark she feared.
</br>
</br>
He felt the boy's concerned hand on his. This sweet touch from the world.</br>

 Perhaps history this century, thought Eigenvalue, is rippled with gathers in its fabric such that if we are situated, as Stencil seemed to be, at the bottom of a fold, it's impossible to determine warp, woof, or pattern anywhere else. By virtue, however, of existing in one gather it is assumed there are others, compartmented off into sinuous cycles each of which had come to assume greater importance than the weave itself and destroy any continuity. Thus it is that we are charmed by the funny-looking automobiles of the '30's, the curious fashions of the '20's, the particular moral habits of our grandparents. We produce and attend musical comedies about them and are conned into a false memory, a phony nostalgia about what they were. We are accordingly lost to any sense of continuous tradition. Perhaps if we lived on a crest, things would be different. We could at least see.</br>

  y mariposa ahogada en el tintero.</br>

One of the amazing characteristics of nature is the variety of interpretational schemes that is possible. It turns out that it is only possible because the laws are just so, special and delicate.... If you modify the laws much you find that you can only write them in fewer ways. I always find that mysterious, and I do not understand the reason why it is that the correct laws of physics seem to be expressible in such a tremendous variety of ways. They seem to be able to get through several wickets at the same time.</br>

Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare's? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of Herschel's great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of hearing? Not at all.&mdash;Why then do you try to 'enlarge' your mind? Subtilize it.</br>

 <i>That Country</i></br>
 </br>
 This is about the women of that country</br>
 Sometimes they spoke in slogans</br>
 They said</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We patch the roads as we patch our sweetheart's trousers</br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart will stop but not the transport</br>
 They said</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have ensured production even near bomb craters</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children let your voices sing higher than the explosions</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the bombs</br>
 </br>
 They said</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have important tasks to teach the children</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the people are the collective masters</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to bear hardship</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to instill love in the family</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to guide the good health of the children (they must</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wear clothing according to climate)</br>
 They said</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once men beat their wives</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now they may not</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a poor family sold its daughter to a rich old man</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the young may love one another</br>
 They said</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we planted our rice any old way</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now we plant the young shoots in straight rows</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so the imperialist pilot can see how steady our</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands are</br>
 </br>
 In the evening we walked along the shores of the Lake</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Restored Sword</br>
 </br>
 I said &nbsp; is it true? &nbsp; we are sisters?</br>
 They said &nbsp; Yes, we are of one family</br>

 <i>Holy Sonnets: Batter my heart, three-person'd God</i></br>
 </br>
 Batter my heart, three-person'd God, for you</br>
 As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;</br>
 That I may rise and stand, o'erthrow me, and bend</br>
 Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.</br>
 I, like an usurp'd town to another due,</br>
 Labor to admit you, but oh, to no end;</br>
 Reason, your viceroy in me, me should defend,</br>
 But is captiv'd, and proves weak or untrue.</br>
 Yet dearly I love you, and would be lov'd fain,</br>
 But am betroth'd unto your enemy;</br>
 Divorce me, untie or break that knot again,</br>
 Take me to you, imprison me, for I,</br>
 Except you enthrall me, never shall be free</br>
 Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me.</br>

   <i>Time of the Missile</i> </br>
  </br>
  I remember a square of New York's Hudson River glinting between warehouses.</br>
  Difficult to approach the water below the pier</br>
  Swirling, covered with oil the ship at the pier</br>
  A steel wall: tons in the water,</br>
  </br>
  Width.</br>
  The hand for holding,</br>
  Legs for walking,</br>
  The eye <i>sees</i>! It floods in on us from here to Jersey tangled in the grey bright air!</br>
  </br>
  Become the realm of nations.</br>
  </br>
  My love, my love,</br>
  We are endangered</br>
  Totally at last. Look</br>
  Anywhere to the sight's limit: space</br>
  Which is viviparous:</br>
  </br>
  Place of the mind</br>
  And eye. Which can destroy us,</br>
  Re-arrange itself, assert</br>
  Its own stone chain reaction.</br>

   <i>Meditation at Lagunitas</i> </br>
  </br>
  All the new thinking is about loss.</br>
  In this it resembles all the old thinking.</br>
  The idea, for example, that each particular erases</br>
  the luminous clarity of a general idea. That the clown-</br>
  faced woodpecker probing the dead sculpted trunk</br>
  of that black birch is, by his presence,</br>
  some tragic falling off from a first world</br>
  of undivided light. Or the other notion that,</br>
  because there is in this world no one thing</br>
  to which the bramble of <i>blackberry</i> corresponds,</br>
  a word is elegy to what it signifies.</br>
  We talked about it late last night and in the voice</br>
  of my friend, there was a thin wire of grief, a tone</br>
  almost querulous. After a while I understood that,</br>
  talking this way, everything dissolves: <i>justice,</i></br>
  <i>pine, hair, woman, you</i> and <i>I</i>. There was a woman</br>
  I made love to and I remembered how, holding</br>
  her small shoulders in my hands sometimes,</br>
  I felt a violent wonder at her presence</br>
  like a thirst for salt, for my childhood river</br>
  with its island willows, silly music from the pleasure boat,</br>
  muddy places where we caught the little orange-silver fish</br>
  called <i>pumpkinseed</i>. It hardly had to do with her.</br>
  Longing, we say, because desire is full</br>
  of endless distances. I must have been the same to her.</br>
  But I remember so much, the way her hands dismantled bread,</br>
  the thing her father said that hurt her, what</br>
  she dreamed. There are moments when the body is as numinous</br>
  as words, days that are the good flesh continuing.</br>
  Such tenderness, those afternoons and evenings,</br>
  saying <i>blackberry, blackberry, blackberry</i>.</br>

  These poems</br>
  they are things I do</br>
  in the dark</br>
  reaching for you</br>
  whoever you are</br>
  and</br>
  are you ready?</br>
  </br>
  These words</br>
  they are stones in the water</br>
  running away</br>
  </br>
  These skeletal lines</br>
  they are desperate arms for my longing and love.</br>
  </br>
  I am a stranger</br>
  learning to worship the strangers</br>
  around me</br>

  whoever I may become.</br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busy old fool, unruly sun,</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why dost thou thus,</br>
 Through windows, and through curtains call on us?</br>
 Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late school boys and sour prentices,</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go tell court hunstmen that the king will ride,</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call country ants to harvest offices,</br>
 Love, all allike, no season knows nor clime,</br>
 Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.</br>
 </br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy beams, so reverend and strong</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why shouldst thou think?</br>
 I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink,</br>
 But that I would not lose her sight so long;</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If her eyes have not blinded thine,</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, and tomorrow late, tell me,</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether both th'Indias of spice and mine</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be where thou lefst them, or lie here with me.</br>
 Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday,</br>
 And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay.</br>
 </br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's all states, and all prince, I,</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing else is.</br>
 Princes do but play us; compared to this,</br>
 All honor's mimic, all wealth alchemy.</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou, sun, art half as happy as we,</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that the world's contracted thus.</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To warm the world, that's done in warming us.</br>
 Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;</br>
 This bed thy center is, these walls, thy sphere.</br>
